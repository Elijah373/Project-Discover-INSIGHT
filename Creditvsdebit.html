            <section class="content">
                <p>In today’s world, both credit and debit cards are widely used for making purchases. However, there are key differences between these two types of cards that can affect your spending, financial management, and credit history. Understanding these differences is important for making smart financial decisions.</p>

                <h2>What Is a Debit Card?</h2>
                <p>A debit card is linked directly to your bank account, meaning that when you make a purchase, the money is immediately deducted from your account balance. Essentially, you are using your own money to pay for things.</p>

                <h3>Pros of Debit Cards:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Easy access to your funds:</strong> Debit cards allow you to directly use the money in your checking or savings account.</li>
                    <li><strong>No debt accumulation:</strong> Since you’re spending your own money, there’s no risk of falling into debt.</li>
                    <li><strong>No interest:</strong> Unlike credit cards, debit cards don’t charge interest on purchases.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cons of Debit Cards:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No credit building:</strong> Debit card usage doesn’t impact your credit score, so it won’t help you build credit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited fraud protection:</strong> Debit cards usually offer less protection against fraud compared to credit cards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Overdraft fees:</strong> If you spend more than what’s in your account, you may incur overdraft fees.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What Is a Credit Card?</h2>
                <p>A credit card allows you to borrow money from a bank or credit card issuer to make purchases. Instead of drawing from your own funds, you are using the issuer’s money, which you will need to pay back over time. If you don’t pay your balance in full each month, you may be charged interest.</p>

                <h3>Pros of Credit Cards:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Build credit:</strong> Proper credit card usage can help build your credit score, which is important for taking out loans or applying for a mortgage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fraud protection:</strong> Credit cards usually offer better fraud protection, and many issuers provide zero liability for unauthorized charges.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Many credit cards offer cashback, travel points, or other rewards for purchases.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cons of Credit Cards:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Interest charges:</strong> If you don’t pay off your balance in full, you may accrue interest charges on the outstanding amount.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk of debt:</strong> Since you’re borrowing money, there’s a risk of falling into debt if you overspend and can’t pay it back.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fees:</strong> Some credit cards come with annual fees, late payment fees, and other costs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Which Should You Use?</h2>
                <p>Both debit and credit cards have their place depending on your financial situation and goals. If you want to avoid debt and only spend what you have, a debit card is a safer option. On the other hand, if you’re looking to build credit and enjoy rewards, using a credit card responsibly could be a better choice. Ideally, a balanced approach, using both types of cards where appropriate, can help you manage your finances wisely.</p>
